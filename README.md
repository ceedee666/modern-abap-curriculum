# Modern ABAP Curriculum

This repository contains the documentation and source code for an ABAP
curriculum developed as part of the [WiLMo](https://www.dh.nrw/kooperationen/OERContent.nrw%202021-95) project,
with a focus on modern ABAP programming in the context of [SAP S/4HANA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP_S/4HANA)
and the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).

## Overview

ABAP is the proprietary
programming language developed by [SAP SE](https://www.sap.com/) and is the basis of the ERP-Software offered by SAP.
Initially introduced in 1976, ABAP has evolved over the years.
This [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/09/01/evolution-of-abap/) by [Karl Kessler](https://people.sap.com/karl.kessler)
gives a nice summary of the history of the ABAP programming language.
The aim of this curriculum is to provide an
introduction to modern ABAP programming techniques and frameworks.

### Learning Objectives

The curriculum aims to achieve the following learning objectives:

1. Enable students to compare the advantages and disadvantages of different extension
   technologies for a given requirement based on a thorough understanding of the SAP S/4HANA architecture.
1. Enable students to implement extensions to an SAP S/4HANA system using state-of-the-art
   ABAP to automate business processes not implemented in the SAP S/4HANA standard.
1. Enable students to implement extensions using the ABAP RAP framework and SAP Fiori
   Elements to enhance SAP S/4HANA using the SAP best practices.

## Prerequisites

### ABAP Development Environment

For students and lecturers at universities, different options exist for getting access to an ABAP development environment.
The [SAP University Competence Centers](https://www.sap-ucc.com/) offer ABAP development system to universities (cf. the
[product list](https://portal.ucc.ovgu.de/services-produkte_rv/produktliste/) of the [SAP UCC Magdeburg](https://portal.ucc.ovgu.de/)).
Another option is to use the [trial or free tier offerings](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/trial.html)
of the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). Finally, it is also possible to self-host the
[ABAP Developer Trial](https://hub.docker.com/r/sapse/abap-cloud-developer-trial).

### ABAP Programming Language

This curriculum assumes a basic knowledge of the ABAP programming language. There
are various resources available online for learning ABAP, such as books, lectures,
video tutorials, and online courses. The following list contains just a few examples:

- Books

  - Franz, T., & Kühnhauser, K.-H. (2019). Einstieg in ABAP (5., aktualisierte und erweiterte Auflage). Rheinwerk.
  - Hardy, P. (2022). ABAP to the future (4th edition). Rheinwerk Publishing, Inc.

### Other Technologies and Concepts

In addition to basic knowledge of the ABAP programming language, a basic understanding
of the following technologies and concepts is required to follow the curriculum:

- [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
- [OData](https://www.odata.org/)
